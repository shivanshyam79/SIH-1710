## Problem Title: Smart Carbon Footprint Tracker
SIH 1710: Enhancing Navigation for Railway Station Facilities and Locations
## Problem Description
Background: Railway stations are complex environments with numerous facilities and locations such as ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, food courts, and waiting areas. Passengers often face difficulties in navigating these spaces, especially in large or unfamiliar stations. Efficient and user-friendly navigation systems are crucial for improving passenger experience, reducing congestion, and ensuring timely travel connections. Description: The problem involves developing a comprehensive navigation solution for railway stations that assists passengers in locating various facilities and destinations within the station premises. This includes creating detailed maps, providing real-time directions, and integrating features such as accessibility options for individuals with disabilities. The solution should be intuitive, easy to use, and accessible via multiple platforms, including mobile devices and digital kiosks. Key challenges include updating navigation information in real-time, ensuring accuracy, and accommodating the diverse needs of all passengers. Expected Solution: The expected solution is a multi-platform navigation system that provides detailed, real-time directions to all facilities and locations within a railway station. This system should include: A mobile application with 3D interactive maps and step-by-step navigation. Digital kiosks located throughout the station with touch-screen interfaces. Voice-guided navigation for visually impaired passengers. Regular updates to reflect changes in station layout and facility locations. Integration with existing railway apps and services for seamless user experience. The solution should enhance the overall passenger experience by reducing confusion, saving time, and improving accessibility within the station.

## Idea
 Smart Carbon Footprint Tracker: EcoGuardian
 
Automated Travel Carbon Tracking – Uses GPS and ride-hailing data to calculate emissions from cars, flights, cycling, and public transport in real time. Suggests greener alternatives like carpooling or biking.

Smart Home Energy Monitor – Connects with smart meters & IoT devices to track electricity, gas, and water usage. Provides tips on reducing power consumption and switching to renewable energy.

AI-Based Diet & Shopping Impact – Scans grocery receipts or integrates with food delivery apps to calculate the carbon footprint of food choices. Suggests plant-based alternatives and sustainable brands.

Gamified Carbon Score & Challenges – Assigns a Carbon Score based on lifestyle habits, with weekly eco-challenges (e.g., "Go plastic-free for a week!"). Users can compete with friends and earn eco-rewards.

Offset & Social Sharing – Allows users to donate to carbon offset projects (tree planting, clean energy) directly from the app. Users can also share their eco-progress & achievements on social media.
